                    Returning to his comedic roots, McConaughey starred in 1999's EdTV as a lowly clerk who becomes the star of his own reality
                    show. The film was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Later that year, McConaughey began
                    developing some notoriety for his offbeat off-screen behavior. The police visited his Austin, Texas,
                    home after receiving a noise complaint in 1998. There, they discovered a naked McConaughey playing the
                    bongos and found a small amount of marijuana. McConaughey was booked on drug charges and for resisting
                    arrest. The drug charges were later dropped, but the actor paid a fine for violating a local noise ordinance.
