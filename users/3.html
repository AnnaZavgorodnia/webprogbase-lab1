                    Despite strong pressure from her older siblings to ditch school and embark on an acting career, Lively initially expressed
                    no interest in acting. Instead, she had her own dreams of attending Stanford University. Nevertheless,
                    sensing her star potential, her older brother Eric relentlessly pushed her to try auditioning. "He was
                    trying to get me to make life decisions at 15!" she recalls. He then began contacting agents and telling
                    them about his beautiful, talented younger sister. "I was really busy at school," Lively remembers, "and
                    I would have these agents calling and saying, 'We have an appointment for you.' It was really hard to
                    say no, because I didn't want to make my brother upset."
