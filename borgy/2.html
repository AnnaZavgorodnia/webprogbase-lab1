        of information publicly available at Prosper.com. The estimated APR presented does not bind Prosper or the lending
        partner. The range of APRs available through Prosper is 6.95% to 35.99%. Only borrowers with excellent credit qualify
        for the lowest rate available. Your actual APR depends upon credit score, Prosper Rating, loan amount, loan term,
        credit usage and history. All loans are subject to credit review and approval. All loans made by WebBank, member
        FDIC. **Based on responses from randomly selected borrowers in good standing who received a loan from 01/01/2016
        to 11/20/2016. Survey conducted was of a statistically significant sample size with a 95% confidence level and a
        3.94% margin of error.
