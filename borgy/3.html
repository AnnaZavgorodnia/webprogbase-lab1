        *1. Fixed rates from 6.990% APR to 14.865% APR (with AutoPay). Variable rates from 6.255% APR to 12.555% APR (with AutoPay).
        SoFi rate ranges are current as of September 1, 2018 and are subject to change without notice. Not all rates and
        amounts available in all states. See Personal Loan eligibility details. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest
        rate. If approved for a loan, to qualify for the lowest rate, you must have a responsible financial history and meet
        other conditions. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of
        factors, including evaluation of your credit worthiness, years of professional experience, income and other factors.
        See APR examples and terms. Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at 14.95%. Lowest variable rate of 6.255%
        APR assumes current index rate derived from the 1-month LIBOR of 2.08% plus 4.425% margin minus 0.25% AutoPay discount.
        For the SoFi variable rate loan, the 1-month LIBOR index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized
        and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the LIBOR index increases.
        The SoFi 0.25% AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments
        by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for
        periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. To check the rates and
        terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. However, if you choose
        a product and continue your application, we will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting
        agencies, which is considered a hard credit pull. See Consumer Licenses (https://www.sofi.com/legal#licenses). 2.
        Rates shown reflect the 25th percentile of funded Credit Karma users between April 1, 2018 â€“ June 30, 2018. 3. If
        you lose your job through no fault of your own, you may apply for Unemployment Protection. SoFi will suspend your
        monthly SoFi loan payments and provide job placement assistance during your forbearance period. Interest will continue
        to accrue and will be added to your principal balance at the end of each forbearance period. Benefits are offered
        in three month increments, and capped at 12 months, in aggregate, over the life of the loan. To be eligible for this
        assistance you must provide proof that you have applied for and are eligible for unemployment compensation, and you
        must actively work with our career services department to look for new employment.
